# The policy file is ignored unless it is allowed by "khulnasoft policy allow" command

You may face the warning when you try to install or execute packages.

e.g.

```console
$ khulnasoft i
WARN[0000] The policy file is ignored unless it is allowed by "khulnasoft policy allow" command.

$ khulnasoft policy allow "/Users/shunsukesuzuki/Documents/test/khulnasoft/policy-git/khulnasoft-policy.yaml"

If you want to keep ignoring the policy file without the warning, please run "khulnasoft policy deny" command.

$ khulnasoft policy deny "/Users/shunsukesuzuki/Documents/test/khulnasoft/policy-git/khulnasoft-policy.yaml"

## What does this warning mean?

This warning means your Policy file isn't allowed yet.
The Policy is ignored unless you allow the Policy.

## How to solve the warning

Please check your Policy file. If the Policy file has no problem, please run `khulnasoft policy allow` command according to the warning.

e.g.

```sh
khulnasoft policy allow "/Users/shunsukesuzuki/Documents/test/khulnasoft/policy-git/khulnasoft-policy.yaml"
```

If the Policy allows untrusted Registries and you don't want to allow them, please fix the Policy file before allowing the Policy.

If you want to suppress the warning but don't want to allow the Policy file, please run `khulnasoft policy deny` command according to the warning.

e.g.

```sh
khulnasoft policy deny "/Users/shunsukesuzuki/Documents/test/khulnasoft/policy-git/khulnasoft-policy.yaml"
```

This command suppresses the warning but the Policy is ignored unless you run `khulnasoft policy allow` command.
