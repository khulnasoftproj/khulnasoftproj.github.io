# the executable file isn't installed yet. Lazy Install is disabled

You may face the error when you execute a command managed by khulnasoft.

e.g.

```console
$ tfcmt -v
FATA[0000] khulnasoft failed                                   khulnasoft_version= doc="https://khulnasoftproj.github.io/docs/reference/codes/006" env=darwin/arm64 error="the executable file isn't installed yet. Lazy Install is disabled" exe_name=tfcmt package=sulaiman-coder/tfcmt package_version=v1.0.0 program=khulnasoft
```

## What does this error mean?

This error occurs when Lazy Install is disabled and the executed command isn't installed yet.

Please see [Disable Lazy Install](/docs/reference/lazy-install#disable-lazy-install) too.

## How to solve the error

Install packages by `khulnasoft i` without `-l` option before executing commands.

```console
$ khulnasoft i
```

GitHub Actions [khulnasoftproj/khulnasoft-installer](https://khulnasoftproj.github.io/docs/products/khulnasoft-installer/#github-actions) uses `-l` option by default, so please disable `-l` option with the input `khulnasoft_opts`.

e.g.

```yaml
- uses: khulnasoftproj/khulnasoft-installer@v2.1.1
  with:
    khulnasoft_version: v2.9.0
    khulnasoft_opts: ""
```

Or if you'd like to enable Lazy Install, please remove the environment variable `KHULNASOFT_DISABLE_LAZY_INSTALL`.
